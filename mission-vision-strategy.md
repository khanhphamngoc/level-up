### Question: Now help me to connect the two sets below
- vision, mission, strategy 
- why, what, how

### Answer: 
To connect the two sets, we can map them as follows:

 * Why → Mission and Vision:
   * Vision: The "why" at the highest level. It's the ultimate destination, the ideal future you want to create. It answers the question, "Why do we exist in the long run?" or "What's the world we want to see?"
   * Mission: This is the more concrete "why." It's the reason the organization exists right now. It answers the question, "Why are we doing this?" or "What is our purpose?" It explains the value you provide to your customers or stakeholders.

 * What → Strategy:
   * The "what" is the strategy. It's the plan of action—what you will do to achieve your mission and move toward your vision. It answers the question, "What will we do to succeed?" or "What is our overall approach?" It involves making choices about where to compete and how to win.

 * How → Strategy (Tactics/Execution):
   * The "how" is the implementation of the strategy. It's the specific actions, tactics, and processes you will use to execute the strategy. It answers the question, "How will we do it?" or "How will we put our plan into action?" While strategy is the "what," the "how" is the detailed execution that makes it a reality.


### Question: In the linkedin post, the author said vision is the what. Could you elaborate more on that?

### Answer: 
You've brought up an interesting and common point of contention in business and strategic planning. The core of the issue is that the terms "vision," "mission," and "strategy" are often used interchangeably or defined differently by various people and organizations.

When an author says "vision is the what," they are likely using a different framework than the one I initially presented. Here's a breakdown of that perspective and why it makes sense to some:

In this alternative view:

 * Why → Mission: This is the purpose-driven part. It's the reason the company exists today. It answers the question, "Why do we do what we do?" It's about the company's core values, its role in the market, and the problem it's solving for its customers.

 * What → Vision: The vision is a picture of the future you want to create. It's the "what" you will achieve. It answers the question, "What will the future look like when we succeed?" or "What is our end goal?" This perspective sees the vision as the destination itself, the tangible outcome of the company's efforts.

 * How → Strategy: The strategy is the plan for getting to that future state. It's the "how" you will execute to achieve the vision. It answers the question, "How will we make the vision a reality?" This includes the specific actions, initiatives, and allocation of resources needed to reach the destination.

**Why this framework is popular:**

This perspective is often adopted because it's a very clear and actionable model.

 * Starts with a purpose (Mission): You start by defining your fundamental reason for being.
 * Sets a destination (Vision): You then paint a picture of the future, a clear end-state that everyone can aim for.
 * Creates a roadmap (Strategy): Finally, you create the detailed plan to get there.

Both frameworks are valid, but they use the same terms to describe different relationships. The key is to be consistent within your own organization and communication. The important thing is to have a clear understanding of your purpose, a compelling picture of your future, and a solid plan to get there, regardless of which word you use to describe each component.
