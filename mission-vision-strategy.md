### Question: Now help me to connect the two sets below
- vision, mission, strategy 
- why, what, how

### Answer: 
To connect the two sets, we can map them as follows:

 * Why → Mission and Vision:
   * Vision: The "why" at the highest level. It's the ultimate destination, the ideal future you want to create. It answers the question, "Why do we exist in the long run?" or "What's the world we want to see?"
   * Mission: This is the more concrete "why." It's the reason the organization exists right now. It answers the question, "Why are we doing this?" or "What is our purpose?" It explains the value you provide to your customers or stakeholders.

 * What → Strategy:
   * The "what" is the strategy. It's the plan of action—what you will do to achieve your mission and move toward your vision. It answers the question, "What will we do to succeed?" or "What is our overall approach?" It involves making choices about where to compete and how to win.

 * How → Strategy (Tactics/Execution):
   * The "how" is the implementation of the strategy. It's the specific actions, tactics, and processes you will use to execute the strategy. It answers the question, "How will we do it?" or "How will we put our plan into action?" While strategy is the "what," the "how" is the detailed execution that makes it a reality.


### Question: In the linkedin post, the author said vision is the what. Could you elaborate more on that?

### Answer: 
You've brought up an interesting and common point of contention in business and strategic planning. The core of the issue is that the terms "vision," "mission," and "strategy" are often used interchangeably or defined differently by various people and organizations.

When an author says "vision is the what," they are likely using a different framework than the one I initially presented. Here's a breakdown of that perspective and why it makes sense to some:

In this alternative view:

 * Why → Mission: This is the purpose-driven part. It's the reason the company exists today. It answers the question, "Why do we do what we do?" It's about the company's core values, its role in the market, and the problem it's solving for its customers.

 * What → Vision: The vision is a picture of the future you want to create. It's the "what" you will achieve. It answers the question, "What will the future look like when we succeed?" or "What is our end goal?" This perspective sees the vision as the destination itself, the tangible outcome of the company's efforts.

 * How → Strategy: The strategy is the plan for getting to that future state. It's the "how" you will execute to achieve the vision. It answers the question, "How will we make the vision a reality?" This includes the specific actions, initiatives, and allocation of resources needed to reach the destination.

**Why this framework is popular:**

This perspective is often adopted because it's a very clear and actionable model.

 * Starts with a purpose (Mission): You start by defining your fundamental reason for being.
 * Sets a destination (Vision): You then paint a picture of the future, a clear end-state that everyone can aim for.
 * Creates a roadmap (Strategy): Finally, you create the detailed plan to get there.

Both frameworks are valid, but they use the same terms to describe different relationships. The key is to be consistent within your own organization and communication. The important thing is to have a clear understanding of your purpose, a compelling picture of your future, and a solid plan to get there, regardless of which word you use to describe each component.

🔗 Connecting Vision, Mission, Strategy with Why, What, How

🧭 Primary Mapping Framework

To align the sets — vision, mission, strategy with why, what, how — we can map them in the following way:

✅ Why → Mission and Vision
	•	Vision: The highest-level “why” — the ultimate destination or the future you want to create.
It answers: “Why do we exist in the long run?” or “What kind of world do we want to shape?”
	•	Mission: A more concrete version of “why” — the organization’s present-day purpose.
It answers: “Why are we doing this?” or “What is our purpose today?”

⸻

✅ What → Strategy
	•	Strategy defines what you will do to realize the mission and move toward the vision.
It answers: “What actions will we take?” or “What is our plan to win?”

⸻

✅ How → Execution (Tactics)
	•	The “how” is about how you implement the strategy.
It answers: “How will we execute our plan?” or “What processes, systems, and tactics will we use?”

⸻

💡 Alternative Framework: Vision as the “What”

In some business literature (such as the LinkedIn post you mentioned), vision is framed as the “what” instead of the “why.” This comes from a different but also valid strategic planning approach:

🔄 Remapped Interpretation
	•	Why → Mission
The purpose behind current existence.
“Why do we do what we do?”
	•	What → Vision
The envisioned future.
“What will success look like?”
	•	How → Strategy
The roadmap.
“How will we make that vision come true?”

⸻

📌 Why This View Is Popular
	•	Mission = Purpose → Anchors the organization in meaning and values.
	•	Vision = Destination → Defines a clear, compelling future state.
	•	Strategy = Path → Breaks down the journey into actionable steps.

This model is especially actionable because it encourages clarity at every level — from purpose to destination to execution.

⸻

🎯 Final Thoughts

Both interpretations are valid. The key is to be internally consistent and ensure everyone in the organization clearly understands:
	1.	Why you exist (Mission)
	2.	What you’re trying to achieve (Vision)
	3.	How you’ll get there (Strategy)

Regardless of naming conventions, the alignment between purpose, ambition, and execution is what ultimately drives meaningful results.
