# Team Models and Topologies at Amazon, Microsoft, and Netflix

## Why These Companies Evolved Team Models
All three (Amazon, Microsoft, Netflix) operate at massive scale, serve millions of customers globally, and continuously innovate on products and services. They need to:
- Deliver fast and frequently without breaking things
- Maintain high customer trust (security, reliability, compliance)
- Cultivate a product mindset rather than just building features
- Empower engineers to operate with autonomy and accountability

Because of this, they could not rely on traditional, hierarchical, functional team structures. Instead, they moved toward product-aligned, cross-functional, empowered teams, also known as stream-aligned teams in Team Topologies language.

## Amazon
### ‚ÄúTwo-Pizza Teams‚Äù and Service-Oriented Model
**Model adopted:**
- Small, autonomous, cross-functional "two-pizza teams" ‚Äî small enough that two pizzas can feed the team
- Each team owns a service end to end, including design, build, run, and evolve
- API-first and microservices architecture: each team exposes services via APIs, minimizing dependencies

**Why:**
- Customer obsession: teams can directly focus on improving customer experiences without central bottlenecks
- Engineering mastery: teams are free to choose the best tools and innovate, as long as they meet guardrails
- Safety and resilience: each service is isolated, so failures don‚Äôt cascade
- Product mindset: each team acts as a mini-startup, owning metrics and outcomes

## Microsoft
### Product-Aligned Feature Teams & Engineering Excellence
**Model adopted:**
- Product/feature teams aligned to business capabilities (e.g., Azure Compute, Office 365 Teams)
- Integration of PM, engineering, design, data, and ops into the same team
- Emphasis on inner source: code is internally open for contributions, promoting engineering craftsmanship

**Why:**
- Customer-centric: deeply understand how customers use products and iterate faster
- Engineering mastery: focus on quality, reliability, and scale, particularly with cloud products like Azure
- Product mindset: teams take end-to-end ownership of features or capabilities, with KPIs tied to customer outcomes
- Safety and resilience: using SRE (Site Reliability Engineering) practices, strong incident response, and design for failure

## Netflix
### ‚ÄúFreedom & Responsibility‚Äù and Loosely Coupled, Highly Aligned Teams
**Model adopted:**
- Small, autonomous teams with maximum freedom to decide what and how to build
- Strong focus on alignment via clear context, not control ‚Äî top-down mandates are avoided
- Embrace of "you build it, you run it" ‚Äî teams operate and support their services in production


**Why:**
- Customer-centric: quick experimentation (e.g., A/B tests) and direct measurement of customer engagement
- Engineering mastery: high bar for technical skills, continuous learning, "stunning colleagues" principle
- Product mindset: teams own specific user journeys or platform capabilities fully
- Safety and resilience: chaos engineering, strong culture of learning from failure, automation of resilience

## Why these models work for product mindset, engineering mastery, customer-centricity, and resilience

| Principle            | How these models support it                                                                 |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Product mindset      | Teams own outcomes and metrics, not just outputs                                          |
| Engineering mastery  | Autonomy enables tech innovation, continuous improvement                                  |
| Customer-centricity  | Short feedback loops, direct measurement of customer impact                               |
| Safety & resilience  | Decoupled services, strong SRE or DevOps practices, failure learning culture              |
